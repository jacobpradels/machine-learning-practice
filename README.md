# Machine Learning Practice Problem
This is a practice project for implementing machine learning algorithms like TensorFlow to process machine vision problems.

## What does it do?
This program will randomly select images from a data set of dog images, analyze them, and determine the frequency of breeds that were randomly selected.  This information is exported in JSON format for easy readability and flexibility.

## Where did I get the data set?
The data set can be found at http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/main.html

## Dependencies
TensorFlow 2.4.1</br>
NumPy 1.19.5</br>
Python 3.6.5
